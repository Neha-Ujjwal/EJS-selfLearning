# EJS-selfLearning

Express.js is a Node.js framework . i's the most popular framework as of now (the most starred on NPM).

ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build Websites,web apps and backends. 

why do we actually need Express.js?

try to write a small REST API server in plain Node.js(that is,using only core modules) and then in Express.js.The latter will take you 5-10x less time and lines of code.

imp!! In NPM package manager , we can't use any capital letter in name of package.It doesnot allow it.
